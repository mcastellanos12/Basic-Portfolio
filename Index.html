  <p> Hello Human! My name is Michelle and as you can probably tell, I am very new to the Web Development World! Besides learning to code, I love to spend time with my family, travel, and watch my San Antonio Spurs dominate the court. I also enjoy playing basketball but I'm pretty terrible.  </p>
  <br>
  <p> I also love discovering new music and artists. In high school, I was that kid that would be constantly burning CDs and sharing them with friends. I do not burn CDs anymore but I can definitely spend a few hours on Youtube discovering new music. </p>
